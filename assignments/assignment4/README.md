## Brief

- Add another image element to the page representing a food the mouth won't eat (it prefers flies!)
- Make the new element draggable, but make the mouth reject it if you drag it over (look up the `accept` property of droppables) and make it return to its original position when rejected (look up the `revert` property of draggables)
- Add a sound effect of disgust (like "yuck!") and make it play when the user starts dragging the unwanted food item (look up the `start` property of draggables)

__NOTE:__ This brief is the bare minimum of additions in order to pass, please always use these assignments as a playground to try out more than the bare minimum!
