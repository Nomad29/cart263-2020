## Course outline

- The [Course Outline](https://github.com/pippinbarr/cart263-2019/blob/master/course-information/course-outline.md) is on GitHub
- It gives the basic information for the course and serves as a kind of 'contract' between us
- Let's look at it...

---

## Course schedule

- The [Course Schedule](https://github.com/pippinbarr/cart263-2019/blob/master/course-information/course-schedule.md) is on GitHub
- There is a section for each week that will contain slides, notes, resources, assignments, etc.

???

- These slides are written in [remark.js](https://github.com/gnab/remark) which allows text written in [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) to be displayed as slides

---

## Slides and notes

- You are expected to follow along with the slides on your own computer, just click the appropriate link in the [Course Schedule](https://github.com/pippinbarr/cart263-2019/blob/master/course-information/course-schedule.md)
- When viewing the slides, press `F` for full-screen and `P` for presenter view
- You can also view the information from the slides as __notes__ by clicking on the appropriate link - when you view them as notes the presenter notes are visible by default

???

- This is an example of a presenter note which can be seen in the 'notes' version of this presentation

---

## Course resources

- The [External Resources](https://github.com/pippinbarr/cart263-2019/blob/master/course-information/external-resources.md) page is on GitHub
- It contains a bunch of links to external resources you may find helpful during the course
- However the course is designed to be self-sufficient so don't feel like you have to read them all
- If you find a resource you think is great, let Pippin know and he'll add it

---

## Course software setup

- There is a page about [Software Setup](https://github.com/pippinbarr/cart263-2019/blob/master/course-information/course-software-setup.md)
- This is intended to help those of you who want to use your own computers to do so
- Hopefully you've already done this
- If you haven't, do it now quietly while still listening to the class
