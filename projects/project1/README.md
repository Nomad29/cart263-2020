## Grading

Grading for exercises is based on the following three categories (with associated weightings):

__Implementation (50%)__. Runs without errors. Meets the key technical requirements. Complexity/ambition of code. Use of technical ideas and features that go beyond what has been seen in class. Clear indication of code obtained from other sources (e.g. StackExchange, examples on website). Code is well-structured and easy to understand.

__Creativity (30%)__. Uses code to create an interesting and expressive experience for the user. Has a clear point of view and conveys it well. Uses code in surprising ways to create new ideas. Artist's statement clearly explains the design and implementation in terms of its desire effect.

__Style (20%)__. Numerous and well-written commits. Use of good programming style (commenting, following naming conventions).
